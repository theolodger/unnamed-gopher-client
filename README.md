Project Goals
-------------

The goal of this project is to create a client that attracts people to the Gopher community, and entices them to _stay for the ride_:

- [x] Suggest the most active Gopher communities to get started
- [x] Make it easy to search the Gopherspace and start exploring
- [ ] Aggregate phlogs into feeds to help following creators and giving them a bigger audience
- [ ] Curate the best and most active Gopherholes
- [ ] Figure out a way to let users interact with creators, or show them support, without changing the Gopher experience
- [ ] Show engaging media inline, if desired

It aims to provide features that are _unique_ to the Gopher experience:

- [x] Multi-column drill-down navigation like Finder
- [x] View pages as folders and files
- [ ] Inline and tree navigation like Explorer
- [ ] Keyboard and number-based navigation

And of course, all of the features that we have come to expect:

- [x] Tabs
- [x] Browsing history
- [x] Recently visited pages
- [x] Aggressive caching
- [x] Downloads
- [x] Combined search and address bar
- [x] A welcome and start page
- [ ] User bookmarks
- [ ] Theming & Dark Mode
- [ ] Deep link support (for all platforms)
- [ ] Full drag and drop capabilities
- [ ] Extensions for new Gopher types and Rendering modes
- [ ] Security via TLS
