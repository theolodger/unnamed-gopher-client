Project Goals
-------------

The goal of this project is to create a client that helps people approach the Gopher community, and entices them to _stay for the ride_:

- [ ] Suggest the most active Gopher communities to get started
- [ ] Aggregate phlogs into feeds to help following creators and giving them a bigger audience
- [ ] Figure out a way to let users interact with creators
- [ ] Make it easy to search the Gopherspace and start exploring
- [ ] Show media inline, if desired

It aims to provide features that are _unique_ to the Gopher experience:

- [ ] View pages as folders and files
- [ ] Inline and tree navigation like Explorer
- [ ] Multi-column drill-down navigation like Finder
- [ ] Keyboard and number-based navigation

And of course, all of the features that we have come to expect:

- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Browsing history
- [ ] Bookmarks and recently-visited
- [ ] Downloads
- [ ] Aggressive caching
- [ ] Combined search and address bar
- [ ] A welcome and start page
- [ ] Deep link support
- [ ] Theming & Dark Mode
- [ ] Extensions for new Gopher types and Rendering modes
- [ ] Security via TLS
